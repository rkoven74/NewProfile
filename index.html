<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have a BS Degree in Managment and have worked as a contractor in various fields. I also worked in the legal field for almost 2 decades. About 5 years ago
I took a job in IT and totally loved it! I am excited to be attending a Boot Camp through the University of Denver. I want to get a great job so that I can better support
my family. </p>
<p>I have traveled overseas and had the opportunity of live in Kuwait. When I was in the Middle East, I traveled to Alexandria Egypt. Which was like taking a step back in time.
Alexandria was modern to some degree, but to my surprise there were sheep herders and super poor people. There were laundry lines used to dry clothes and the apartments in the city 
looked really run down.</p></section>
